The project will include three components

<ol>

 <li>A Zoom presentation with charts. The presentation will be seven to eight minutes long. You’ll share your screen with everyone and then present. Since you’ll be sharing your charts with everyone, your camera shouldn’t be turned on. Please rehearse your presentation so you don’t run out of time. I will cut you off if you run over and we’re running behind schedule.</li>

 <li>The charts for your Zoom presentation. The charts can be in in PowerPoint, Google Slides, Apple Keynote, PDF, or whatever other format you prefer, as long as I can read it on my Windows PC. Please submit your charts via Blackboard and label your file as lastname_firstname.xxx where xxx will depend on the format of the charts.</li>

 <li>A written report (in PDF format). The report will be 10 to 15 pages in length (double spaced). If you have lots of tables and/or charts, you can include them in an appendix. Please submit your written report via Blackboard and name your file as lastname_firstname.pdf. If you have code, please submit it as an Jupyter notebook named lastname_firstname.ipynb.</li>

</ol>

Schedule

<ol>

 <li>Your Zoom presentation will be on May 5th, 10th, 12th, or 17th. Prior to Aril 19th I will post a schedule of when you’ll be presenting. I’ll be assigning you randomly to one of these four dates. I can’t push these dates any later since the last day of class is Monday, May17th.</li>

 <li>The charts from your Zoom presentation are due by midnight on Wednesday, May 19.</li>

</ol>

3. Your written report is due by midnight on Friday, May 21. No extensions will be granted since I’ve pushed this as late in the semester as I can.
